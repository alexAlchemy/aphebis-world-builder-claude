# Iron Dominion - Example World Structure

## World Overview
**Name**: Iron Dominion
**Description**: A fractured empire of colossal mechs patrolling radioactive wastelands, where rival clans wage eternal wars over scarce resources. In the irradiated ruins of a fallen interstellar empire, hardened pilots cling to survival amidst radiation storms and colossal mutated beasts. Mech warriors must navigate clan rivalries, hunt radiation-spawned monstrosities for rare mutagen cores, and forge uneasy alliances to survive in the unforgiving wastes. Every battle is a desperate gamble against both steel and the wasteland's fury.
