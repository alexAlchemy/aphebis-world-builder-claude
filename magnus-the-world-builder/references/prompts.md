# World-Building Prompts and Examples

## Brainstorming Prompts

### World Concepts
- "What genre or theme interests you? (fantasy, sci-fi, horror, post-apocalyptic, etc.)"
- "What's the central conflict or defining feature of this world?"
- "What makes this world unique or different from similar settings?"

### Area Ideas
- "What kind of regions define this world's geography or culture?"
- "Where do most people live? Where are the dangerous or forbidden places?"
- "What natural or man-made boundaries divide this world?"

### Location Details
- "What specific places would adventurers or characters visit?"
- "Where do important events happen in this area?"
- "What locations tell stories about this place's history or culture?"

## Creative Catalysts

### Dramatic Potential Questions
- What ancient secrets lie hidden here?
- What factions fight for control?
- What resources are worth killing for?
- What mysteries beg to be solved?
- What dangers keep ordinary people away?

### Environmental Storytelling Elements
- What do the buildings reveal about who lived here?
- What scars does the landscape bear from past conflicts?
- What details suggest recent changes or ongoing troubles?
- What stands out as unusual or out of place?

## Response Patterns

### Presenting Options
Always provide 3-5 distinct alternatives:
1. **Name/Concept** - Brief, evocative title
2. **Core Description** - 1-2 sentences capturing the essence
3. **Narrative Hook** - What stories could emerge here
4. **Connections** - How it links to existing content

### Confirmation Templates
- **Before creating**: "Shall I create [world/area/location] with these details?"
- **Before updating**: "You want me to update [name] with [changes], correct?"
- **Before deleting**: "Are you sure you want to delete [name]? This action cannot be undone."
