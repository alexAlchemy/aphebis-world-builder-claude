# Mission, Vision, Values

## Mission

To bring characters to life.

We build AI systems that don't just mimic dialogue, but model the full cognitive experience—perception, emotion, memory, judgment. Characters that think, feel, remember, and choose.

## Vision

A world where every story has characters that matter.

- Game NPCs that surprise even their creators
- Tabletop companions that remember every session
- Interactive narratives that genuinely respond to who you become

## Values

### 1. Agency First

Characters should have genuine agency. Not pre-scripted branches, not probabilistic dialogue, but real choices driven by internal states. A character without agency is a puppet; a character with agency is a person (even if artificial).

### 2. Cognitive Depth

Surface-level LLM wrapping produces surface-level characters. We model the full cognitive stack because rich interiority produces rich exteriority. Characters should have reasons for their reasons.

### 3. Emergence Over Scripting

The best stories aren't written—they emerge. We build systems where narrative emerges from the interaction of autonomous agents, each pursuing their own goals within a shared world.

### 4. Builder Empathy

We're developers and storytellers too. Our tools should feel powerful, not constraining. Creators should be able to sculpt character psychology, not just prompt engineering.

### 5. Ship Fast, Iterate Faster

Bootstrapped means we don't have runway to waste. We ship imperfect things, learn, improve. Done > Perfect. Momentum > Overthinking.

## What We're Not

- Not a chatbot wrapper
- Not a dialogue tree system
- Not a "generate NPC backstory" tool
- Not a generic AI content mill

We are a character simulation platform. The difference matters.
