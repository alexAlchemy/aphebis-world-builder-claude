# Company Identity

**Name:** Aphebis
**Type:** Early Stage Startup
**Founded:** 2024
**Stage:** Pre-seed / Bootstrapped
**Industry:** AI Character Simulation & Interactive Narratives

## Business Description

Aphebis is building an AI-driven character simulation platform that creates autonomous NPCs through cognitive modeling. Our system models the full cognitive pipeline: Perception → Attention → Memory → Appraisal → Decision → Reflection. We enable rich, emergent storytelling where characters have genuine agency and internal lives.

## Strategic Context

- **Primary Market:** Game developers, narrative designers, tabletop RPG groups, interactive fiction creators
- **Competitive Position:** Deep cognitive modeling vs. simple LLM wrappers
- **Go-to-Market:** Product-led growth, developer tools first, tabletop market second
- **Current Focus:** Core platform development, world-builder tools (Magnus), agent workforce development

## Operating Philosophy

As a bootstrapped startup with no funding:

- **Hustle First:** We move fast, break things, fix them, keep moving
- **Risk Tolerant:** We can take bold bets established companies can't
- **Budget Conscious:** Every expense must justify itself—no tool subscriptions without clear ROI
- **Scrappy Builder Energy:** We ship ugly, iterate fast, polish later
- **AI-Native:** Our workforce IS agents—we eat our own dogfood
